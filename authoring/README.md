# Authoring DCC Credentials

DCC uses the [W3C Verifiable Credentials data model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/). While DCC defines a small set of (optional) metadata to assist with ecosystem tooling, our general approach is to minimize cross-cutting required fields. Instead, we define and maintain a set of credential vocabularies/schemas for use in a variety of use cases.

DCC prefers to reuse standard/well-known linked data contexts and schemas, where available. However, at this point in time, there is not much available. Therefore we will help develop these contexts along with standards organizations and host them until they are able to benefit from official adoption. Note that the W3C CCG may also offer functionality as a context registry in the future.

Recommendations for authoring credentials vary slightly depending on the type of credential data. The [3 types of credential data are described here](credential_content_types.md). Additional recommendations coming soon.

Recommendations for handling display artifacts are available [here](display_artifacts.md).
